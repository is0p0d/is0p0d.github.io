        <P>Howdy! This is a website I intend to use as a plethora of things, but it's being built inbetween college classes and a job. That is to say, if for some reason you're interested in the development of this website - don't check back too frequently!</P>
        <BR>
        <P>Some of the things I hope to have on this website in the future:</P>
        <P>A museum of my vintage computers, my portfolio, and a small blog of progress on my projects.</P>
        <BR>
        <P>I'd also like to keep a purely html version of this website for any vintage computing enthusiasts that would like to visit this sight on older browsers! :)</P>
