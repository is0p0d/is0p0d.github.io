        <H3>Intro</H3>
        <P>
            This is a small set of install notes for the resource allocation management system <a href="https://github.com/ubccr/coldfront" target="_blank">ColdFront</a>. In this, I walk through the <a href="https://coldfront.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy/" target="_blank">ColdFront Deployment docs</a>, and address some pitfalls and hangups that I experience while setting the system up on a small HPC system for my University. Lastly I also describe configuration for the SAML SSO plugin I wrote for ColdFront, and how you should configure your IDP as far as what claims to send and how to format them for the plugin.
            <br>
            <b>NOTE:</b> These installation notes are pretty specific towards the HPC configuration they were made for: An OpenHPC cluster running their versions of Slurm on Rocky 8, with Microsoft EntreID as the IDP.
